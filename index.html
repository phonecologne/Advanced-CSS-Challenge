        <h4>Sample Box #2</h4>
        <p>This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child / And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
          As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate / To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers / And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift / Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain / Excerpt from Shakespeareâ€™s The Tempest / A dozen years; within which space she died / And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans / As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with A human shape.</p>

          <h4>Sample Box #3</h4>
          <p>I must eat my dinner. This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me / Water with berries in't, and teach me how / To name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee / And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: Cursed be I that did so! All the charms / Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me / In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me / The rest o' the island.</p>
