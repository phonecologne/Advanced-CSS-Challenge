          <p>I must eat my dinner. This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me / Water with berries in't, and teach me how / To name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee / And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: Cursed be I that did so! All the charms / Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me / In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me / The rest o' the island.</p>
